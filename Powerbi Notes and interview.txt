Answer:

Easy to use drag-and-drop interface

Integration with Excel, Azure, and other Microsoft tools

Real-time data access

AI-driven analytics

Cloud and on-premises connectivity

Rich visualization library

3. What is a data model in Power BI?

Answer:
A data model defines how tables relate to each other using relationships (one-to-many, many-to-one, etc.) and includes calculated columns, measures, and hierarchies.


4. What are filters in Power BI and types of filters?

Answer:

Visual-level filters: Apply to a single visual

Page-level filters: Apply to all visuals on a report page

Report-level filters: Apply to all pages in a reports


5. What are the file types in Power BI?

Answer:

.pbix → Power BI Desktop file

.pbit → Power BI Template file

.csv, .xlsx → Input data files

6. How do you refresh data in Power BI?

Answer:
You can refresh data manually in Power BI Desktop or schedule refreshes in Power BI Service using Gateways.

7. What is a tooltip in Power BI?

Answer:
A tooltip shows additional information when hovering over a data point, such as detailed metrics or visuals.

1. What is Power BI?

Answer:
Power BI is a business intelligence tool by Microsoft that allows users to connect to various data sources, transform and model data, and create interactive dashboards and reports for data visualization and analysis.

2. What are the key components of Power BI?

Answer:

Power Query – for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)

Power Pivot – for data modeling and DAX calculations

Power View – for creating interactive visualizations

Power BI Desktop – the main development tool

Power BI Service – for online sharing and collaboration

Power BI Mobile – for viewing reports on mobile devices

Power BI Gateway – for connecting on-premises data sources

3. What types of data sources can Power BI connect to?

Answer:
Power BI can connect to:

Databases (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc.)

Online services (SharePoint, Azure, Google Analytics)

Files (Excel, CSV, JSON, XML)

APIs and web data

4. What is the difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service?

Answer:

Power BI Desktop: Used to create reports and data models locally.

Power BI Service: Cloud-based platform used to publish, share, and collaborate on reports.

5. What is a dashboard in Power BI?

Answer:
A dashboard is a single-page, interactive view that contains visuals from multiple reports or datasets. It gives a high-level overview and key metrics at a glance.

6. What is a report in Power BI?

Answer:
A report is a multi-page visualization created from a dataset, used to explore data in depth.

7. What is the difference between a calculated column and a measure in Power BI?

Answer:

Feature	         Calculated Column	         Measure
Stored   	Stored in the model	  Calculated on the fly
Context	         Row context	           Filter context
Use Case	Row-level calculations	  Aggregations (like SUM, AVG)

8. What is Power Query?

Answer:
Power Query is a data transformation and cleansing tool in Power BI used for connecting, transforming, and loading data before modeling.

9. What are relationships in Power BI?

Answer:
Relationships connect tables based on a common column (key). They help Power BI understand how data from different tables relate, enabling cross-table calculations and visuals.

10. What are slicers in Power BI?

Answer:
Slicers are visual filters that allow users to interactively filter data in reports.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Basic Interview Questions

11. What is DAX?

Answer:
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI, Power Pivot, and SSAS to create calculated columns, measures, and custom tables.



12. What are the main types of DAX functions?

Answer:

Aggregate functions: SUM(), AVERAGE(), COUNT()

Filter functions: FILTER(), ALL(), CALCULATE()

Time intelligence functions: SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), TOTALYTD()

Logical functions: IF(), AND(), OR()

Text functions: CONCATENATE(), LEFT(), RIGHT()



13. What is the difference between SUM() and SUMX()?

Answer:

SUM() adds up all values in a single column.
Example: SUM(Sales[Revenue])

SUMX() evaluates an expression for each row and then sums the result.
Example: SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[UnitPrice])

14. What is the difference between row context and filter context?

Answer:

Row context: Exists when Power BI evaluates expressions for each row (used in calculated columns).

Filter context: Applies when filters (like slicers or visuals) affect which rows are included in a calculation (used in measures).


15. What is the use of DISTINCT() in DAX?

Answer:
DISTINCT() returns a one-column table with unique values from a column.
Example:

DistinctRegions = DISTINCT(Sales[Region])


16 . How can you improve performance in Power BI?

Answer:

Use Star Schema model design

Avoid using too many calculated columns; prefer measures

Use proper data types

Reduce data load with query folding

Use aggregations where possible
